# Smoke Point Detection

**Smoke Point Detection (SPD)** is a python-based software that implements an algorithm that allows to perform smoke point characterization of fuel blends tested on the ASTM-D1322 Standarized Lamps. The software uses images taken during the lamp tests and allows to automatically detect the smoke point. 

**The algorithm is an python implementation of the work described in the work of :**
